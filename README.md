Wifi Geolocation from Mac Address
=================================

This script uses the Google Geolocation API to determine the location of a device based on its MAC address.

It's a work in progress, but it's functional.

You need to have a Google API key to use this script. You can get one here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/get-api-key
